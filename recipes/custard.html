    <h2>Description of Custard </h2>

    <p>Custard is a creamy culinary creation made by blending milk or cream with eggs and sugar. It can be baked, as in
        crème brûlée, or stirred on the stove-top for variations like vanilla custard.</p>
    <p>The result is a smooth, velvety texture that serves as a base for desserts such as pies, puddings, and pastries.

    <h2>Procedure to Prepare Custard</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong> Prepare the Ingredients </strong>
            <ul>
                <li> Gather and measure all the ingredients before starting to ensure a smooth cooking process. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> <strong>Mix Egg Yolks and Sugar</strong>
            <ul> 
                <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar until the mixture becomes pale and slightly thickened.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> <strong> Add Cornstarch </strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Sprinkle the cornstarch over the egg yolk mixture and whisk until well combined. This helps thicken the custard.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> <strong>Heat Milk</strong>
            <ul>
                <li> In a saucepan, heat the milk over medium heat until it just begins to simmer. Do not boil. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> <strong>Temper the eggs</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Slowly pour a small amount of the hot milk into the egg mixture while whisking continuously. This tempers the eggs, preventing them from curdling.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Combine Mixtures</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Gradually pour the tempered egg mixture back into the saucepan with the remaining hot milk, whisking constantly to combine.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Cook Custard</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Cook the mixture over medium heat, stirring continuously with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula. Continue until the custard thickens enough to coat the back of the spoon.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Remove from Heat</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Once the custard reaches the desired thickness, remove the saucepan from heat.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> <strong> Add Vanilla and Salt </strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Stir in the vanilla extract and a pinch of salt, combining well.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> <strong>Cool and Chill </strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Allow the custard to cool slightly before transferring it to a bowl or individual serving dishes.</li>
                <li>Cover the custard with plastic wrap, ensuring it touches the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate until fully chilled.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
