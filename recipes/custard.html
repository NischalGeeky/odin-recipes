    <h2>Description of Custard </h2>
    
    <p>Custard is a creamy culinary creation made by blending milk or cream with eggs and sugar. It can be baked, as in crème brûlée, or stirred on the stove-top for variations like vanilla custard.</p>
    <p>The result is a smooth, velvety texture that serves as a base for desserts such as pies, puddings, and pastries.</p>
